# UT99

Starting off with an nmap scan

I used HexChat after looking at the ports

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

Found UnReal tournament to be running

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

Searching for exploits I came across this

{% embed url="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16145" %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

And got a rev shell

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

### Priv Esc

Found FoxitCloudUpdateService

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

It seems to be running as administrator



Made a rev shell using msfvenom and named it as the Foxit.exe

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

Replaced the file on the shell

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png>)

and restarted the machine

Now I had a shell with administrator privileges
